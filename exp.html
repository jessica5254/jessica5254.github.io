            <h1>Work Experience</h1>
            <p>After 8 years of expereience in leadership and management positions, I bring exceptional facilitating
                skills and a proven ability to promote cohesive teamwork. In my supervisory roles, I've honed
                organizational and decision-making abilities, efficiently guiding teams toward common goals. I excel in
                creating a collaborative work environment, fostering open communication, and motivating individuals to
                contribute their best efforts, aiming to lead, not boss. Through effective delegation and mentorship, I
                consistently enhance team productivity and cultivate a positive work environment. My commitment to my
                team is to help them grow, and drive success. In addition to my roles of management, I have also worked
                in roles of customer service, both retail and call center, manufacturing, and pharmacy, giving me well
                rounded experience in several different fields.</p>
